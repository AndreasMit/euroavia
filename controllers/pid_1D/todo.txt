    TODO:
        - Check if it works
        - Clamping saturation limit values:
          cut final output before 2000, for example at 1600.
          Motors are powerfull and I wouldn't want to be near them running full speed.
          After all, we dont need so much power.
        - [throttle + PID] to right or [throttle - PID]?
        - If it works, find a way to control desired_angle with a controller
        - MPU6050 angle reading? How to correct it...
        - Plot measure angle
        

        - Integrate numerically in a better way?
        - Differentiate numerically in a better way?
        - Introduce an anti-windup method for the integrator
        - 1st order low pass filter to the derivative?

        - Try to derive a "Transfer Function" to work on the problem in a 
          more mathematical way with other control theory methods
              First principles?
