    TODO:
        - If it works, find a way to control desired_angle with a controller
        - Plot measure angle (Serial Plotter) ?
        - (!) we better use angle X and not Y. For some reason there is less shift there
        - Using gyro data at K_D instead of differentiating
        - Make arduino loop faster, take more measurements and average them out
          They say that a nice loop frequency is 1000Hz [MPU -  GYRO:8kHz ACC:1kHz]

          Sensor Sample Rate:
              Sample Rate = Gyroscope Output Rate / (1 + SMPLRT_DIV)
              Gyroscope Output Rate : 8kHz when DLPF is disabled or 1kHz when DLPF is enabled
              SMPLRT_DIV: value stored in register 25 (see register map)

        - MPU 9250?

        - Introduce an anti-windup method for the integrator

        - Maybe try to use arduino PID library instead of making our own.
          It'll be easier in the future where we will need more pids running at the same time

    GENERAL:

        - Build an airplane
        - GPS navigation - Waypoint mission
        - Pitot sensor for speed control
        - Pressure sensor for altitude control
        - Data logger got analysis
        - Design a pcb for the flight controller
