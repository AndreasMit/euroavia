    TODO:
        - Check if it works
        - [throttle + PID] to right or [throttle - PID]?
        - If it works, find a way to control desired_angle with a controller
        - Plot measure angle (Serial Plotter) ?
        - We also need an IMU with a magnetometer. It counteracts the gyro angle shift
        - (!) we better use angle X and not Y. For some reason there is less shift there
        - Make arduino loop faster, take more measurements and average them out
          They say that a nice loop frequency is 1000Hz [MPU -  GYRO:8kHz ACC:1kHz]
        - Moving Average Filter

        - Integrate numerically in a better way?
        - Differentiate numerically in a better way?
        - Introduce an anti-windup method for the integrator

        - Try to derive a "Transfer Function" to work on the problem in a 
          more mathematical way with other control theory methods
              First principles?

        - Maybe try to use arduino PID library instead of making our own.
          It'll be easier in the future where we will need more pids running at the same time

    GENERAL:

        - Build an airplane
        - GPS navigation - Waypoint mission
        - Pitot sensor for speed control
        - Pressure sensor for altitude control
        - Data logger got analysis
        - Design a pcb for the flight controller
