    TODO:
        - Check if it works
        - [throttle + PID] to right or [throttle - PID]?
        - If it works, find a way to control desired_angle with a controller
        - Plot measure angle (Serial Plotter) ?

        - Integrate numerically in a better way?
        - Differentiate numerically in a better way?
        - Introduce an anti-windup method for the integrator

        - Try to derive a "Transfer Function" to work on the problem in a 
          more mathematical way with other control theory methods
              First principles?
