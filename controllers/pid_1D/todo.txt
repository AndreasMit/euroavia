    TODO:
        - Check if it works
        - [throttle + PID] to right or [throttle - PID]?
        - If it works, find a way to control desired_angle with a controller
        - Plot measure angle (Serial Plotter) ?
        - Reintroduce the mpu6050 library. Its hard to build it manually, especially the filters etc
        - We also need an IMU with a magnetometer. It counteracts the gyro angle shift
        - (!) we better use angle X and not Y. For some reason there is less shift there

        - Integrate numerically in a better way?
        - Differentiate numerically in a better way?
        - Introduce an anti-windup method for the integrator

        - Try to derive a "Transfer Function" to work on the problem in a 
          more mathematical way with other control theory methods
              First principles?
