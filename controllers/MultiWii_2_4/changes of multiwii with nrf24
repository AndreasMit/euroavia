9,6,5,3 instead of 9,10,11,3 //that what electo did

i used the same order as electro but i changed the pidmix ( the place where each motor is by default) 
thus i kept the special settings made for pin 5 and 6 (software pwm ) and just changed their place 

i also remove line 436 in output.cpp which for some reason reduces a lot the pwm signal and thus the motors stop and restart causing serious delay in response while 
flying.

file changed in comparison with original Multiwii:
multiwii.ino
multiwii.cpp
nrf24rx.cpp
nrf24rx.h
output.cpp
rx.cpp
config.h
def.h

Settings that i changed are in the files:
i only change files output.cpp and config.cpp
also changed the CE,CSN in nrf_rx.cpp file.

!i tried to merge the multiwii_nrf with dc motors with multiwii_ppm with bldc motor
